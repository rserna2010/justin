<h1>Bio:</h1>
<p>Justin White was born and raised in Washington Heights, New York City. He grew up playing tennis for 11 years, and competed in the USTA on both regional and national levels. He attended Hunter College High School, where he was captain of the varsity tennis team and also played varsity basketball. </p>

<p>Justin went on to study Anthropology and Psychology at Harvard University. While at Harvard, Justin slowly began to acknowledge a <i>long-standing interest</i> in the performing arts, hosting a few comedy and talent shows. Justin knew by this time that he had a love for entertaining and performing: channeling his high amounts of emotional and physical energy to embody various characters and entertain others. But, he didn't do much about it.</p>

<p>After college, Justin entered corporate America for over 2 years, working in consulting, advertising, and marketing. He eventually started studying and performing in theatre on the side. Feeling unsatisfied, he soon left corporate America to pursue his passion full-time.</p>

<p>Today, Justin is building a strong resume in theatre, film & television, as well as commercials. He recently appeared as <i>Aufidius</i> in the <a href="http://www.harlemshakespearefest.org/">Harlem Shakespeare Festival</a>'s production of <i>Coriolanus</i>, and also appeared in their summer 2013 production of <i>Antony & Cleopatra</i>. He has also performed at New Federal Theatre. On TV, Justin has appeared on Comedy Central, Investigation Discovery, and A&E. In film, Justin recently appeared in Aleta Chappelle's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3122216/"><i>Romeo and Juliet in Harlem</i></a>. He has done commercials for Foot Locker/Reebok and NJ State Tourism, and industrial/print work for Pepsi, NFL, AT&T, Metro PCS, US Army, Diadora, and ImageSource.  </p> 

<p>Justin has studied with Petronia Paley (monologue and scene study), Alice Spivak (scene study, New Federal Theatre), Upright Citizens Brigade (improv), and Aleta Chappelle (TV & film acting).</p>
